### timerpool library 
Thread-safe software timerpool implementation in Nim.

This library simplifies handling and running 
very much timers (constrained by memory).
The timers itself are not designed for 
critical time-measuring purposes. It´s for 
event purpose only

the module documentation can be found [here](https://mikra01.github.io/timerpool/timerpool.html) 

At the moment only tested on the windows10 platform.
Comments, bug reports and PR´s always welcome.
